# communication-between-components

> Different ways to communicate components
We will see three ways to communicate between components:
- Emitting custom events
- By callback functions
- Event bus (best I think)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
